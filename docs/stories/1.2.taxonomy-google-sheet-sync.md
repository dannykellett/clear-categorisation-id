# Story 1.2: Taxonomy Google Sheet Sync

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** classification system,
**I want** to automatically sync taxonomy data from Google Sheets with validation and versioning,
**so that** I can provide up-to-date category hierarchies for text classification while maintaining system stability.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. [x] Taxonomy sync polls Google Sheets on schedule (every 5-10 min) and on-demand via admin endpoint
2. [x] System validates sheet schema (required columns, no cycles, no orphans, tiers contiguous)  
3. [x] System builds versioned taxonomy (e.g., `tax_vYYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`) and caches in Redis/in-process
4. [x] System exposes `/taxonomy/version` and `/taxonomy/preview` endpoints for debugging
5. [x] Failed validation keeps serving prior valid version and emits alerts
6. [x] Only rows where `Classification Type` == `Event Type` are considered
7. [x] Hierarchy follows `Classification tier 1` → `tier 2` → `tier 3` → `tier 4` columns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 (FastAPI Classification Endpoint):
- Successfully implemented FastAPI application structure with uv package manager
- Established app/ module structure with core/, routers/, models/, engine/ directories
- Implemented structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Created comprehensive test suite pattern with pytest
- Mock classification engine implemented as placeholder for real functionality

### Data Models
**Google Sheets Data Structure** [Source: prd/4-taxonomy-source-of-truth.md]:
- Sheet URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LQEbAKH7KjAFfuMR1pWK9rSqaBfpkRi8DDw_7gU_qTg (tab: `event_type`)
- Filter condition: Only rows where `Classification Type` == `Event Type`
- Required columns: `Classification tier 1`, `tier 2`, `tier 3`, `tier 4`
- Hierarchy structure: tier 1 → tier 2 → tier 3 → tier 4 (hierarchical progression)

**Taxonomy Version Format** [Source: prd/4-taxonomy-source-of-truth.md]:
- Version pattern: `tax_vYYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` (e.g., `tax_v20250814_103000`)
- Caching: Redis or in-process for MVP
- Validation rules: No cycles, no orphans, tiers contiguous

**API Response Models** [Source: prd/5-functional-requirements.md#53]:
- `/taxonomy/version`: Returns current taxonomy version and metadata
- `/taxonomy/preview`: Returns taxonomy structure for debugging

### API Specifications
**Admin Endpoints** [Source: prd/5-functional-requirements.md#53]:
- `GET /taxonomy/version` - Returns current taxonomy version info
- `GET /taxonomy/preview` - Returns taxonomy structure for debugging  
- `POST /taxonomy/sync` - Manual sync trigger (admin endpoint)

**Sync Strategy** [Source: prd/4-taxonomy-source-of-truth.md]:
- Schedule: Every 5-10 minutes polling
- On-demand: Admin endpoint trigger
- Validation: Schema + hierarchy rules
- Failure behavior: Keep serving prior valid version, emit alerts

### Component Specifications  
**Taxonomy Synchronization Flow** [Source: architecture/4-data-flow-architecture.md#43]:
```
Scheduler → TaxonomySync → Google Sheets → Validator → Cache/Database
```
- Scheduler triggers sync (cron/webhook)
- TaxonomySync fetches sheet data (CSV/JSON)
- Validator checks structure & rules
- Results stored in database and cache
- Sync events emitted for monitoring

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure and Story 1.1 implementation:
- Taxonomy service: `app/services/taxonomy.py`
- Google Sheets client: `app/clients/sheets.py`
- Validation logic: `app/validators/taxonomy.py`
- Admin router: `app/routers/admin.py` (extend existing)
- Models: `app/models/taxonomy.py`
- Background tasks: `app/tasks/scheduler.py`
- Tests: `tests/services/`, `tests/clients/`, `tests/validators/`

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/10-quality-testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit Tests (70%): Taxonomy validation logic, Google Sheets client behavior, caching mechanisms
- Integration Tests (25%): Full sync workflow, admin endpoint functionality, scheduler behavior
- End-to-End Tests (5%): Complete taxonomy sync process, error recovery scenarios

**Test Coverage**: >95% required for deployment
**Testing Framework**: pytest (as established in Story 1.1)
**Mock Strategy**: Mock Google Sheets API calls, test with various data scenarios

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/5-technology-stack-dependencies.md]:
- Redis 7+: Caching and session storage (for taxonomy caching)
- httpx: HTTP client for Google Sheets API integration
- structlog: Structured logging (already implemented in Story 1.1)
- FastAPI background tasks: For scheduled operations

**Package Management**:
- Use `uv` package manager as established in Story 1.1
- Use `uv add` for new dependencies (Redis client, Google API client)
- Use `uv run` for executing tests and background tasks

**Performance Requirements** [Source: architecture/6-scalability-performance.md#62]:
- Sync operations should not block API requests
- Background sync every 5-10 minutes as specified
- Cache invalidation must be atomic

**Logging Requirements** [Source: architecture/9-monitoring-observability.md#91]:
- Use existing structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Log sync events, validation failures, and version changes
- Include taxonomy version in classification request logs

### Testing
**Test File Locations**: 
- `tests/services/test_taxonomy.py`
- `tests/clients/test_sheets.py` 
- `tests/validators/test_taxonomy.py`
- `tests/routers/test_admin.py` (extend existing)

**Test Standards**:
- Use pytest framework (established in Story 1.1)
- Async test patterns for background tasks
- Mock Google Sheets API with httpx mock
- Test validation scenarios: valid/invalid hierarchies, missing columns, cycles, orphans
- Test caching behavior and version management

**Testing Frameworks**: pytest, httpx for HTTP client testing, pytest-asyncio for background tasks
**Test Execution**: Use `uv run pytest` as established
**Dependencies**: Use `uv add --dev` for test-only dependencies
