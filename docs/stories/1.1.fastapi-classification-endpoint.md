# Story 1.1: FastAPI Classification Endpoint

## Status
✅ **APPROVED** - Ready for Production

## Story
**As a** client application,
**I want** to send text classification requests to a FastAPI endpoint,
**so that** I can receive categorized text responses with confidence scores and reasoning.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. [ ] Given valid text input, the API returns one or more category paths with confidence and reasoning
2. [ ] The `/classify` endpoint accepts single text classification requests
3. [ ] The `/classify/batch` endpoint accepts batch text classification requests  
4. [ ] API responses include confidence scores (0.0-1.0) and human-readable reasoning
5. [ ] Provider/model selection works per request and logs usage
6. [ ] Basic health endpoints `/healthz` and `/readyz` are available

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Set up FastAPI application structure (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Initialize project with `uv` if needed
  - [x] Use `uv add` to install FastAPI, Pydantic, and Uvicorn dependencies
  - [x] Create main FastAPI app with basic configuration
  - [x] Set up router structure for classify endpoints
  - [x] Configure ASGI server (Uvicorn) settings
- [x] Task 2: Implement classification router endpoints (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Create `/classify` POST endpoint for single text
  - [x] Create `/classify/batch` POST endpoint for multiple texts
  - [x] Define Pydantic request/response models
  - [x] Implement input validation and error handling
- [x] Task 3: Add health check endpoints (AC: 6)
  - [x] Implement `/healthz` basic application health
  - [x] Implement `/readyz` dependency readiness check
  - [x] Add dependency status validation
- [x] Task 4: Integrate with classification engine (AC: 1, 4, 5)
  - [x] Connect API routes to classification engine
  - [x] Implement provider/model selection logic
  - [x] Add usage tracking and logging
- [x] Task 5: Unit testing (All ACs)

**Router Structure** [Source: architecture/3-component-architecture.md#31]:
```
routers/
├── classify.py          # /classify, /classify/batch
├── admin.py             # /healthz, /readyz, /providers
```

**Models Structure** [Source: architecture/3-component-architecture.md#31]:
```
models/
├── requests.py          # Pydantic request models
└── responses.py         # Pydantic response models
```

### Component Specifications
**FastAPI Characteristics** [Source: architecture/3-component-architecture.md#31]:
- Stateless: No session state maintained
- Async: Fully async/await for I/O operations
- Resilient: Circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Observable: Structured logging with correlation IDs

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/5-technology-stack-dependencies.md#51]:
- FastAPI 0.104+: High-performance async web framework
- Pydantic 2.0+: Data validation and serialization
- Uvicorn: ASGI server for production deployment

### File Locations
**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/3-component-architecture.md#31]:
- Main app: `main.py` or `app/main.py`
- Routers: `app/routers/classify.py`, `app/routers/admin.py`
- Models: `app/models/requests.py`, `app/models/responses.py`
- Middleware: `app/middleware/` (for future logging/auth)

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/10-quality-testing-strategy.md#101]:
- Unit Tests (70%): API endpoint functionality, data model validation
- Integration Tests (25%): Full request/response flow
- Test Coverage: >95% required for deployment
- Testing Framework: pytest

**Quality Gates** [Source: architecture/10-quality-testing-strategy.md#102]:
- All tests pass with >95% coverage
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks met

### Technical Constraints
**Package Management**:
- Use `uv` as the package manager for dependency management
- Use `uv add` for adding dependencies instead of pip
- Use `uv run` for executing Python commands and scripts
- Initialize project with `uv` if not already done

**Performance Requirements** [Source: architecture/6-scalability-performance.md#62]:
- Synchronous API: p95 < 2s, p99 < 5s
- API: 100 RPS per instance target

**Logging Requirements** [Source: architecture/9-monitoring-observability.md#91]:
- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Include: timestamp, level, service, trace_id, event details

### Testing
**Test File Location**: tests/routers/test_classify.py, tests/routers/test_admin.py
**Test Standards**: 
- Use pytest framework
- Async test patterns for FastAPI testing
- Mock external dependencies (classification engine)
- Test both success and error scenarios
**Testing Frameworks**: pytest, httpx for async client testing
**Test Execution**: Use `uv run pytest` to execute tests
**Specific Requirements**: 
- Test request/response validation
- Test health check dependency validation
- Integration test for full classification flow
- Use `uv add --dev pytest httpx` for test dependencies
